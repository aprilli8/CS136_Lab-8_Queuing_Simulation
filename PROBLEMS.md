# Lab 8: Thought Questions

 1. Run several simulations of both types of queues. Which queue strategy seems to process all the customers fastest? (_Note: For your simulations to be meaningful, they should represent a realistic situation. Customers should not overwhelm the tellers, and tellers should not be completely idle. When answering this thought question, give and justify the parameters you chose for your simulation._)
  * Your answer here.
 2. Is their a difference between the average wait time for customers between the two techniques? (_A Customer's wait time is the difference between the time that a Customer appears in the simulation and the time that the Customer first begins receiving service from a teller. The wait time should not include the time that a Customer is actively receiving service._) Give the intuition for your results.

 3. Suppose you simulated the ability to jump between lines in a multiple line simulation. When a line has two or more customers than another line, customers move from the end of one line to another until the lines are fairly even. You see this behavior frequently at grocery stores. Does this change the type of underlying structure you use to keep customers in line?
  * Your answer here.
 4. Suppose lines were dedicated to serving customers of varying lengths of service times. Would this improve the average wait time for a customer? If yes, how? If not, why not?
  * Your answer here.
